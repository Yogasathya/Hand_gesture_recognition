# Hand_gesture_recognition
The Hand Gesture Recognition System uses Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to enable real-time hand tracking via webcam. It detects and visualizes hand landmarks, forming a base for gesture-controlled apps like UI navigation, robot control, and sign language interpretation, enhancing human-computer interaction.
